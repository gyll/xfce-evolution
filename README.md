The Xfce Evolution theme attempts to rid the Xfce desktop of visual distractions by providing a more consistent look (buttons, scrollbars, menus, etc) across older and newer applications (Gtk2/3, Qt4/5, wxWidgets2/3).

Blends well with 'elementary Xfce darkER' icon set and 'Noto Sans 9' fonts.

Based on Ambiance gtk2, Adwaita gtk3, and Greybird xfwm.
