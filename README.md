The Xfce Evolution theme attempts to rid the Xfce desktop of visual distractions by providing a consistent look (buttons, scrollbars, menus, etc) across older and newer applications (Gtk2/3, Qt4/5, wxWidgets2/3).

Maintenance for this theme has been discontinued, the followup theme is <a href="https://github.com/gyll/classiclooks/">Xfce ClassicLooks<a/>
